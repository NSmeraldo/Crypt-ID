Senior Design 2 final project

## **UI:**

Initially I set up the UI to scale to a 1080 x 1920 aspect ratio as it would be the best way to scale across multiple android devices

The panels include the rules (seen below) so that players can swap to the rules and swip across

Using the Page swiper script I set up the rules so that the panels seamlessly swipe across each other similar to swapping panels normally on a phone when looking at Apps. It also takes into account the amount of panels so that players can not swipe off of the rules on either side and lose them completely.

I was in charge of also setting up the Splash screen shown when the app opens as well as setting the APIs for the app to function completely on smartphones
